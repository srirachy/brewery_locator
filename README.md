# Restaurant Locator React Project

## Description
This project has the following requirements:
- App should use `styled-components` for styling rather than scss/regular css
- App should use `react-router-dom` for conditional rendering different page elements
- App should use a React-specific mapping package and load search results onto the map as pushpins
- App should have a search bar that allows a user to specify a new location to search in. After user search, the map should recenter and show results in the new location
- Pull data from external API using `axios`, `fetch`, or a similar tool. Make sure that the app runs a search for results in the default location upon render, displays search results, and displays pushpins for those results on the map
- App should have a separate location details "page" that the user can navigate to by clicking on a search results. This location details component should not receive its data via props and should instead use `useEffect()` to pull location details from the API after initial render
- Hide an API keys using a `.env` file. Remember to add the `.env` file to the `.gitignore` so that it is not uploaded to GitHub
- App should have multiple components. Use props to pass data from parent components into child components to allow customization of the child components
- Make code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) as possible 

This project utilizes SASS, JS, and React to run.
